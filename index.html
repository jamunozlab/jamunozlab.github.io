        <h3> &ensp; computational physics <br>
            &ensp; at The University of Texas at El Paso</h3>
        
        <p> &ensp; Our group develops scientific theories and computational methods <br> &ensp; to understand the many facets of thermodynamics, including chaos <br> &ensp; and systems out of equilibrium, both in the atomistic and continuum <br> &ensp; regimes. </p>

        <p> &ensp; Some of the pipelines that we develop are machine learning or <br> &ensp; mathematical optimization techniques that we combine with code <br> &ensp; that simulates physical phenomena, while others make a connection <br> &ensp; between the parameter space of learning models and the phase space <br> &ensp; of physics.</p>

        <p> &ensp; We leverage mentoring, camaraderie, and the pursuit of science  for <br> &ensp; the personal and professional growth of our members and contribute <br> &ensp; to the educational and economic development of the El Paso del Norte <br> &ensp; region.</p>

        <p> &ensp;This website is work in progress.</p>
